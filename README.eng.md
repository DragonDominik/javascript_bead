## Self-scoring

Mark all completed tasks with [X] symbol. Reminder: all minimum requirements MUST be completed, otherwise the home assignment will be rejected.

### Minimum Requirements (without these, submission will not be accepted – 8 points)

- **Environment**
  - [ ] The README.eng.md file in the starter package is filled out (declaration, self-scoring).
  - [ ] The game is created without using any JavaScript frameworks.
  - [ ] The solution fully avoids the practices listed under the bad practice section.
- **Menu**
  - [ ] In the main menu, the player can enter their name before starting a new game.
  - [ ] Clicking the Start button navigates to the game screen.
  - [ ] The menu provides access to a description of the game's rules, especially regarding controls (e.g. how to draw a section: drag/clicking/arrows...).
- **Game**
  - [ ] On the game screen, the player’s name is displayed, along with a timer updating every second, and the name/color of the current metro line being constructed.
  - [ ] The board and station locations are rendered on the game screen.
  - [ ] A section can be drawn between two stations, following the grid rules (either 90° or 45° angles).

### Core Tasks (12 points)

- **Cards (1.5 points)**
  - [ ] 0.5 points: A random station card can be drawn from the deck (including the ability to draw the next card without drawing on the board).
  - [ ] 0.5 points: The deck contains only the specified cards (A-B-C-D-Joker for middle platforms and A-B-C-D-Joker for side platforms).
  - [ ] 0.5 points: The Joker card functions correctly.
- **Building segments (5.5 points)**
  - [ ] 0.5 points: Segments can only be drawn from the current metro line's end to the station indicated on the current card.
  - [ ] 0.5 points: Joker station works correctly.
  - [ ] 1.0 point: Segments cannot intersect.
  - [ ] 0.5 points: Parallel segments are not allowed (only one segment between any two stations).
  - [ ] 0.5 points: A segment cannot lead to a station already visited by the same metro line (no loops).
  - [ ] 1.0 point: Sections cannot pass through other stations (each section touches exactly two stations).
  - [ ] 1.5 points: Sections can also be built diagonally at 45° angles.
- **Rounds (1.5 points)**
  - [ ] 0.5 points: The order of rounds (colors/metro lines) is pre-generated and displayed (we can see the current round).
  - [ ] 1.0 point: After the 8th card is drawn, the round ends and a new line/color begins.
    - [ ] _Or for 0.5 partial points: A button allows manual transition to the next round at any time (starts new metro line/color)._
- **Scoring (3.5 points)**
  - Round scoring works
    - [ ] 0.5 points: Number of districts covered (PK)
    - [ ] 0.5 points: Maximum number of stations in a single district (PM)
    - [ ] 0.5 points: Number of Danube crossings (PD)
    - [ ] 0.5 points: Round score FP = (PK × PM) + PD
    - [ ] _Or for 0.5 partial points: If the above cannot be implemented, partial points may be awarded if the round score equals the number of stations covered._
  - Game scoring works
    - [ ] 0.5 points: Junctions — how many stations are visited by two lines (P2), three lines (P3), or four lines (P4)
    - [ ] 0.5 points: Points for visiting train stations are shown on a "slider" during gameplay (PP)
    - [ ] 0.5 points: Final Score = Sum(FP) + (PP) + (2 × P2) + (5 × P3) + (9 × P4)

### Extra Tasks (5 points)

- [ ] 0.5 points: Alternative round-ending condition: There are two types of station cards (side platform and central platform). If the fifth card of either type is drawn, no more cards can be drawn — instead, a "End Round" button must be pressed.
- [ ] 1.0 point: At the end of the game, the player's name, score, and completion time are saved (in local storage), and results can be viewed in the menu in descending order of score.
- [ ] 1.5 points: The switch card functions properly.
- [ ] 2.0 points: Pencil abilities (see Gameplay > Extra task: New Game Mode.
